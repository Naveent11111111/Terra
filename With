Keep systems available, reliable, and resilient

Minimize manual ops work (Toil)

Improve incident response

Enable faster deployments without sacrificing reliability

üîë Key Concepts in SRE
Concept	Description
SLI (Service Level Indicator)	A metric that measures system behavior (e.g., latency, uptime)
SLO (Service Level Objective)	A target for the SLI (e.g., 99.9% uptime)
SLA (Service Level Agreement)	A formal agreement with customers on expected service level
Error Budget	The allowed threshold of failure; drives decision-making between reliability and velocity
Toil	Manual, repetitive, automatable work that SREs aim to eliminate
Incident Management	Structured process for detecting, responding to, and learning from outages

üîß SRE Responsibilities
Automating operations (CI/CD, deployments, monitoring)

Creating and enforcing SLOs

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)

Observability (logs, metrics, traces)

Handling on-call and incident response

Chaos engineering & load testing

Scaling systems safely
